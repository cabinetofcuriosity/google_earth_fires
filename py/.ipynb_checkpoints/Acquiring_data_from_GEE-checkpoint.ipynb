    "My name is Winifred, and I am a second-year student studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I was first exposed to data science one year ago and quickly realized just how applicable it is to various fields of study. After joining the Cabinet of Curiosity team, I learned more about existing natural history databases and collaborated with other team members to dive into and study these databases. I became particularly interested in the [Google Earth Engine database](https://earthengine.google.com/) and the vast amount of geophysical, climate, and imagery data it contained. Data visualization was also something I wanted to learn more about, which led me to exploring California wildfire data from the Earth Engine database and using Plotly to create a map that represented this data..

    "Google Earth Engine hosts satellite imagery and other geospatial data and is a tool that allows for analysis of these datasets, which are made available for global-scale data mining. Images of Earth may go back more than 40 years and are ingested on a daily basis. Datasets include the USGS/NASA Landsat catalog, precipitation data, elevation data, and many more. Earth Engine also allows users to upload their own data for analysis. \n",
