    "Google Earth Engine hosts satellite imagery and other geospatial data and is a tool that allows for analysis of these datasets, which are made available for global-scale data mining. Images of Earth may go back more than 40 years and are ingested on a daily basis. Datasets include the USGS/NASA Landsat catalog, precipitation data, elevation data, and many more. Earth Engine also allows users to upload their own data for analysis. \n",
