    "Google Earth Engine hosts satellite imagery and other geospatial data and is a tool that allows for analysis of these datasets, which are made available for global-scale data mining. Images of Earth may go back more than 40 years and are ingested on a daily basis. Datasets include the USGS/NASA Landsat catalog, precipitation data, elevation data, and many more. Earth Engine also allows users to upload their own data for analysis. \n",

For fire data source, I chose MODIS C6, which is an instrument data used to detect the fires. My date range of choice was September 1st 2017 to September 1st 2018, and I decided to download it as a .csv file. Finally, you must enter your email so that FIRMS can send the data to you.
